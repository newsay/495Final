# Scheduling OnDemand
Capstone Project for SDEV495, University of Maryland 2019

# Description
Scheduling OnDemand is a scheduling web application that allows users to view and self-assign to shifts that are currently available to be covered. Management can create, modify, and delete shifts as business demand increases or decreases to maximize business profit by ensuring all fillable schedules are covered.
Scheduling OnDemand is unique in that itâ€™s an efficient and low overhead solution to publishing schedules that are available to be covered. With some employees only working on an as needed basis it can be very costly to purchase and provide business services like Office 365 in order to create a shared schedule. Scheduling OnDemand instead provides a low-cost solution by allowing management to create users that can access specific schedules and see what shifts are available and can be covered.

# Objective/Purpose
- Allow employees to see the most up to date available schedules.
- Allow managers to create, modify, and delete schedules based off business demand.
- Create a web application that is cost efficient and maximizes business profit by streamlining the process for employees to select and cover available schedules.
- Allow managers to manage users within the web application instead of purchasing costly business service like Office 365 for employees what work on a as needed basis.
- Allow employees to modify their personal information as it changes like addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.
- Allow employees to see what schedules have been assigned to them in order for them to easily keep track and see any updates to their assigned schedules.
